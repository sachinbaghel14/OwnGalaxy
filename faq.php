          <p><strong>What is the Legal Basis of Own Galaxy for selling extra-terrestrial Property? </strong></p>
          <p>Own Galaxy functions in accordance with the 1967 United Nations Outer Space Treaty. </p>

          <p> <strong>Can I transfer my Property or resell it? </strong> </p>
          <p>Yes. However, in order for the transferee to claim the land, a deed of ownership must be issued by Own Galaxy authorizing and recording any such transfers. Once the email has been received informing Own Galaxy of the intent to transfer the property, a nominal charge needs to be paid after which, Own Galaxy will issue a new Certificate in the transferee’s name. </p>

          <p> <strong>How can I transfer my Property? </strong> </p>
          <p>Once Own Galaxy receives the email of the owner intending to transfer his/her property along with the property details, a nominal charge needs to be paid, after which, Own Galaxy will issue a new Certificate in the transferee’s name and such data will be recorded. </p>

          <p> <strong>What is a Moon map?</strong> </p>
          <p>Moon Map is a map of the exact position of  moon as seen from a specific place and time on earth. Each moon map is unique for that location. </p>

          <p> <strong>How do you make the Moon Map?  How accurate is it? </strong> </p>
          <p>The entire library of all celestial objects and each land on moon has been logged by NASA Astronomical Data. </p>
          <p>This data comes from past and present NASA planetary missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. </p>
          <p>We use this data and feed it into our proprietary software which then uses the geographical coordinates and the date-time provided by you to chart out an map of these objects. </p>

          <p> <strong>Do you take bulk orders?</strong> </p>
          <p>Yes, we take bulk orders for Family, corporate gifting, wedding plans, colleges (graduation gift), NGOs, etc. Bulk pricing is based on the quantity for each order so please get in touch with us on customercare.owngalaxy@gmail.com and let us know your requirements. </p>

          <p> <strong>How long does it take to deliver an order?</strong> </p>
          <p>Since each map is custom-made, we take 2-3 working days to design, print your map and other documents. Additional 2-3 days for shipping to any metro city in India, 5-7 days to any other location in India, 10-12 days for countries other than India. So if you’re planning to gift this for a specific occasion, be sure to order at least 2 weeks in advance just to be safe. </p>

          <p> <strong>What is the return policy? Do you accept returns?</strong> </p>
          <p>Sorry, since each document is made specifically for you, we will not be able to accept return as we will not have any further use of the product. In rare cases of damage during transit, we will send you a fresh piece at no cost. </p>

          <p> <strong>**How do I make a payment?</strong> </p>
          <p>We accept online payments via PAYTM. We will soon be adding more payment methods. We do not provide Cash on Delivery service due to customized nature of the product. </p>

          <p> <strong>What does the document include?</strong> </p>
          <p>The documents include the Deed (CERTIFICATE OF OWNERSHIP) , Land map, Information about your land, Personalized Message, Welcome Card and any other customized product added by you during the transaction (Eg. Relationship Agreement, Pictures, Chocolates, Frame etc.) </p>
          <p>We then beautify this map by adding graphics and plotting to create an everlasting piece of art that is ready to adorn your wall forever. </p>
          <p>You can verify the authenticity of our star maps using any open source or free app available to check live sky data (Stellerium is our favourite app). </p>

          <p> <strong>I’m late in ordering, can you expedite my order? </strong> </p>
